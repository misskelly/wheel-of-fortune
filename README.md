### Learning Goals and Objectives

* Write a program from scratch
* Design and implement OOP patterns
* Understand and implement ES6 classes
* Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle)
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Installing / Getting started

If you would like to run our program on your local machine or contribute to future iterations, open your terminal and navigate to the folder you'd like to hold the repository.  Next, run the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/misskelly/wheel-of-fortune.git

$ npm install
```

This will download the file and install the dependencies needed to properly access and run the application.



## Features

* 3 players take turns to "spin a wheel," which returns a random value that will either be points, bankrupt, or lose a turn
* On their turn, player may choose to guess a consonant, buy a vowel, or solve the puzzle
* There are 4 rounds, number of words in the puzzle correspond with the round numner
* Round ends when puzzle solution is correctly guessed

## Future Goals

* Move to a new round successfully
